# RPG-MVC
A MVC project using C# to manage a database of RPG books

Originally, this was intended as a way to teach myself C# and the MVC Framework in .NET by creating a project that I would find practical use out of.  In this case, keeping track of my family's RPG book collection.  I now plan to expand the scope to manage our board games and potentially video games.

This project is informally documented via the Trello board RPG MVC.
